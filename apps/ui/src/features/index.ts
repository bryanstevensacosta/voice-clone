/**
 * Features Layer - User interactions
 *
 * This layer contains features that represent user actions
 * and interactions. Features are reusable across pages and
 * contain business logic for specific user interactions.
 *
 * Features can use entities but should not depend on
 * widgets or pages.

// Export features as they are created
// Example:
// export { CreateProfile } from './profile/create';
// export { DeleteProfile } from './profile/delete';
// export { StartGeneration } from './generation/start';
